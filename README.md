# PR_SNAP_BLURB
This MD should help with PR's for snaps that I want to share upstream.

Firstly, thanks for creating this application! 

I have created a working [snap](https://snapcraft.io/about) that may be [published](https://snapcraft.io/about/publicise) on the snap [store](https://snapcraft.io/store). 

This would allow your application to be leveraged across multiple distributions of Linux and will automatically [updated](https://snapcraft.io/about/release) with any commit to your repo. 

For more info, please reference the snap [docs](https://snapcraft.io/docs).
